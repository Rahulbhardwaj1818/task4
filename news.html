            <h4>TATA MOTERS WANTS TO BUY ITALIAN TRUCK</h4>
            <p>In its biggest acquisition ever, Tata Motors is preparing to acquire Italian truck manufacturer Iveco from the Agnelli family, its main shareholder, for $4.5 billion (3.9 billion). The last significant acquisition by Tata Motors was Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), purchased for $2.3 billion in 2008.
This acquisition would become the Tata Group's second-largest after Corus and the largest for its automotive division, sources familiar with the negotiations told ET.
The sources revealed that both Tata Motors and Turin-based Iveco have scheduled board meetings on Wednesday to approve the deal.</p>
